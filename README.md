# Garrett's Personal Website

Hello! This is the code for my personal website. Feel free to look 
around. It is mainly built with Next.js and Express, and I'm planning
to add database support in the future to store blog entries.

## Running

Clone the repo, then `cd` into the directory and type `npm install` and
then `npm run dev` to run in developer mode. In your browser, navigate
to `localhost:3000` to view the site.

When you update the site, the server should automatically restart and
recompile everything.

## Production build

Make sure you installed all the dependencies with `npm install`. Then
run `npm run build` followed by `npm start`. In your browser, navigate
to `localhost:3000` to view the site.
