                    Welcome to my projects page! Below, you can find a list of my projects, complete and incomplete, along with
                    a short description of each. I consider myself a full stack web developer;
                    a lot of my projects are web applications (usually <b>React</b> and <b>Node.js</b>), but I'm currently learning
                    mobile development with <b>React Native</b>, <b>Flutter</b>, and even native <b>Android</b>.
                    This isn't a comprehensive list by any means, but just the ones I find to be most
                    interesting and meaningful. Feel free to visit my <a href="https://github.com/garrettluu">Github</a> and peruse
                    my repositories if you want to see more!

                        Done as part of the <b>MLH Fellowship</b>. In 4 weeks, our team of 8 fellows built
                        Babel Sandbox, an IDE and educational tool for Babel plugins and presets. Every week,
                        we would meet with Babel maintainer <b>Henry Zhu</b> (acting as the "customer")
                        to demo new features, receive feedback, and just chat about working in open source.

                        I worked on the React front-end, using functional
                        components and hooks to control state (without using Redux ðŸ¤¯). Some of my biggest and most notable contributions are
                        the <a href="https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/babel-sandbox/pull/52">plugin import system</a> and
                        the <a href="https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/babel-sandbox/pull/77">forking and saving of configs</a>.

                        Submitted as part of <b>MLH Hack at Home 2020</b>. For this remote hackathon, I decided to compete solo and really focus on learning
                        a new technology. After hearing about the hype surrounding Flutter, I decided to commit to building a simple CRUD app and learning
                        the Dart language. Coupled with Firebase for the backend, developing on this tech stack was a breeze. In about 12 hours, I was able
                        to finish designing and coding the interface shown below, and ship a simple but complete product.

                        After the hackathon, I decided to refactor the structure of the code to improve readability, modularity, and testability by
                        separating components and applying OOD principles.
                        In the future, I plan to add additional features to improve the user experience, such as <b>user authentication</b>, <b>Calendar API </b>
                        integration, and <b>automatic task scheduling</b>.
